# Greetings!

I'm Naved, freelancing under the alias of **Brown Bread and Jam**, where I blend data and design for freshly-baked solutions. 
Transforming raw numbers into interactive narratives, I thrive on exploratory data analytics and CI/CD automation.


## My Toolbox
- **R & Python:** Data wrangling, scraping, visualization, and machine learning
- **SQL:** Querying, data modeling, and analysis
- **Azure Data Factory:** ETL pipelines and cloud data integration
- **Databricks:** Big data processing and collaborative analytics
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and business intelligence
- **VS Code:** Web development, UX/UI design, and IDE collaboration

## My Assorted Projects
